Simple python program that lets you transfer and convert your music files from pc to usb stick with use of ffmpeg. Only for linux.

# Usage

You can just run it with `python3 ./main.py`. There is also a `music_to_pen/install.py` script that will put files into `$HOME/.local/lib/python3.11/`, `$HOME/.local/bin` and `$HOME/.local/share/applications/`. 

## Updating
Every time you run main.py it checks for newer commits. If it found any it will ask you for updating.
