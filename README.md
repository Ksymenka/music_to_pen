Simple python program that lets you transfer and convert your music files from pc to usb stick with use of ffmpeg. Only for linux.

# Usage

You can just run it with `python3 ./main.py`. There is also a `music_to_pen/install.py` script that will create `music_to_pen.desktop` file and put in in `$HOME/.local/share/applications/`.

## Updating

Every time you run main.py it checks for newer commits. If it found any it will ask you for updating.
